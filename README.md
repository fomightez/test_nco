# test_nco
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fomightez/test_nco/HEAD)

Was trying to sort out why the `patch-binder-gguerrie` branch of https://github.com/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata/ wouldn't build and so this was a test to separate it from there in case it was something associated with it.  
However, it seemed to be a binder issue compounding [the original issue](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/image-build-crashes-while-pushing-layers/34047?u=fomightez), or at least interferring with sorting out the original one.
